This project covers essential Java programming concepts for beginners and intermediate learners.It includes hands-on examples and programs on arrays, methods, strings, and control statements.Each topic is demonstrated with practical Java code for better understanding.Programs follow a modular structure with reusable methods and clear logic.Array operations like sorting, searching, and manipulation are included.String handling covers concatenation, comparison, and built-in methods.User-defined and built-in methods are explained with real use cases.The code is written using basic Java syntax without external libraries.All programs are tested and organized topic-wise in separate files.
